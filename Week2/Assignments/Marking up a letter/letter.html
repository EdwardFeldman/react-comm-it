        <h2>Re: Thank you,Dr Oded Navon, for your response.</h2>

        <p>As you mentioned in your email regarding popular level, by now my research and studies were out of the general public resources:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> mindat.org </li>
            <li> GIA </li>
            <li> Youtube </li>
            <li> ROCK&GEM magazines </li>
            <li> E-books </li>
            <li> local geo-society </li>
            <li> rockhounds of North America </li>
        </ul>
        <p>But I would like to be educated even more.</p>

        <h4>Studies opportunities</h4>

        <p>I was wondering if there would be any resources that are available to free-visits students, aka "Open university style" like it was possible 20 years ago, in the past.</p>
        <p>Also, do you have any pre-recorded webinars for your students that I could watch?</p>
        <p>By now I was most certain that Israel does not have <strong>ANY</strong> studies in high education institutions-it was a big surprise to learn that it is actually exists and is well represented.</p>
        <h4>Curiousity</h4>
        <p>Have you ever visited <strong><em>Tusson, AZ</em></strong>? It's Heaven on Earth for mineralogists.</p>
        <p>Last year the Expo added new yooperlites zone, that was illuminated by UV light to detect the wonders of sodalite (Na<sub>8</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>) fluorescence</p>
        <p>Also, I would like to ask a few questions if you don't mind and I really appreciate it-hate to waste your valuable time:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Where can I study about Israeli Mineralogy?</li>
            <li>What are the current prospected areas, mines in Israel,and new findings?</li>
            <li>Do you use any software in assistance with your studies for cataloging, identification and having a DataBase for future studies?</li>
            <li>Would you be interested in developing such an application tool, what would you expect from an application for you and for future geologists? </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Thank you for all your help and prompt reply earlier.</p>
        <em>Best regards, Edward</em>
